# Face Recognition labs.

Some labs over Face Recognition embeddings in order to study dataset biases effects on neural networks.

Using the [diveface dataset](https://github.com/BiDAlab/DiveFace).

The work is done using the vggface model entirely instead of training over the embeddings because I will be using Grad-CAM to visualice activation regions for each classifier.
